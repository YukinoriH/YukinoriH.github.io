          Hi and thanks for visiting my website! If you're wondering who
          I am, then you've come to the right page. I'm a Candian born
          and rasied in Victoria BC raised by my parents who immigrated
          to Canada from Japan. I graduated from the University of
          Victoria back in 2018 with a BS in Computer Science.
          <br></br>
          Other than my interest in programming, I also like to draw.
          <br></br>
          If you want to contact me, just shoot me an e-mail at yukihayashi42@gmail.com
